                    <p>
                        EcoFinds was founded in 2010 with a simple idea: to make eco-friendly products accessible and
                        affordable for everyone. Over the years, we have expanded our product range and our reach, but
                        our core values have remained the same. We are proud of the positive impact we have made and
                        continue to strive towards a greener future.
